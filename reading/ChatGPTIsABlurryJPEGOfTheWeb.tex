\textbf{Question:}
I have roughly had this idea of ChatGPT being a ``knowledge compressor'' ever since it came out, but I feel as if most people don't really think of it that way.
On the other hand, I do see a lot more content posted online explaining, at least at a high level, how LLMs work and their inherent limitations.
I wonder how many people at least have a general idea of how these things work?
Do most people just think of it as ``computer magic'' or something similar?
