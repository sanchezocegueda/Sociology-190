This reading talks about how AI (specifically LLMs) are a tool for perpetuating hegemony and cultural norms of the people who are most represented in their datasets, meaning powerful people from the US and China, meaning people with colonialist-like interests at heart.
It argues that this is a problem to be solved. Part of it comes from the technological side (reducing bias, AI monitoring). 
Another part lies in our collective power and how we go about changing our values and how we redefine the goals that are to be achieved with AI.

My question is: with the way that things have come to be, meaning that we've created this oligopolistic model in which the most powerful few (technologically, economically, what have you), what bargaining power do people who are against this have?
What are some concrete steps to take in order to begin redirecting the path of AI, away from colonialist uses and towards human flourishing?
What exactly will it take to move away from the current trend?
