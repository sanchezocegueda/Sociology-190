Question:
From the reading, I get the impression that chess was certainly the drosophila of AI until it surpassed human intelligence.
From the Defecating Duck reading, it seems like we humans like to move the goalposts on what makes us human or what intelligence means as soon as we are surpassed.
Therefore, I ask:
was any problem ever suitable to be the drosophila of AI, or were we going to discard any candidate the moment that AI surpassed humans' capabilities in said problem?
