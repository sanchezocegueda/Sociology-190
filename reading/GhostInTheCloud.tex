\textbf{Question:} What are the similarities between how people perceive AI and how they perceive god or other such divine entities?

Why is transhumanism not a religion?

Why are people so keen on justifying their religious beliefs with scientific or  mathematical concepts that they (usually) do not understand?
A lot of the transhumanist talking points appeal to some technical justification.
However, it seems like those who justify their beliefs on resurrection with complicated concepts such as ``quantum superposition'' have little to no experience with the fields that they draw their arguments from.

One (possible) example is Christopher Benek himself (the pastor mentioned in the reading).
I looked him up on his website, and while he has several advanced degrees, none of them are in physics, science, or mathematics.
Now, I am all for self-learning, and if he told me that he does indeed fully understand all these concepts in quantum mechanics, I would be inclined to believe him.
But then I would also like to ask: why aren't other leading experts in these fields pushing for more religious interpretations?
