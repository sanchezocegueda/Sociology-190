The thing that has most preoccupied me in the days since I listened to it is the bizarre and pernicious ideology at the heart of cueingâ€”the idea that a good way to know what a sentence says is to assume it echoes your preconceived ideas about the world.

\textbf{Question:}
% The whole idea of cueing is insane to me.
This reading is very relevant at a personal level, because there is currently a trend in computer science to do ``vibe coding,'' where you ask an LLM agent (Cursor and GitHub Copilot are the most notable examples) to write your code for you.
Some people claim that this will replace programming as we know it nowadays, to the point where most of the code that exists out there will be written by LLMs.
I think this is one of the worst ideas I have heard of in my life.
This is leading to terrible codebases and several people not learning CS fundamentals properly.
However, it begs the question: will ``vibe coding'' make its way into formal means of education, the same way that cueing did for reading?
