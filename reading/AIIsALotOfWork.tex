``Human intelligence is the basis of artificial intelligence, and we need to be valuing these as real jobs in the AI economy that are going to be here for a while.''

``AI doesnâ€™t replace work,'' he said. ``But it does change how work is organized.''

\textbf{Question:}
I wonder if there is a deeper reason why Scale and other such companies are so secretive about annotation work?
Everything seems fishy to me.
Sure, from a PR point of view, it would be scandalous to have the public find out that AI relies on people in Kenya being paid a mere \$1.50 an hour for their work (though it's not like the concept of ``offshoring'' is anything new).
However, is the reason these companies want everything to be so secret that they are actually covering up something illegal?
