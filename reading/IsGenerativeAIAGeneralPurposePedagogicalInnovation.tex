\textbf{Question:}
Is AI really all that helpful?
I feel as if we have all assumed that knowing how to use AI is better than not because it ``makes you more productive.''
But is this true?
How much better do people perform in their tasks when aided by AI (LLMs), and is the difference that significant?
How bad would it be if someone in the future does not have experience with AI, or doesn't know how to ``harness'' it?
